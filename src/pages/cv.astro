    I love to solve problems! My favorite types of problems to solve are the ones that allow me to automate, simplify and help my teams reduce the manual effort needed to get things done. In my role at AWS as a Containers specialist I get to work on a variety of different projects assisting our partners and customers with their GitOps, CI/CD, Infrastructure as code, Containerization and Kubernetes projects.
